...
Our survival strategy is to act aggressively towards the zombies, rushing towards and attacking them first. 
Another priority is to keep our health relatively high in the beginning, so that we may inflict as much damage as possible. 
By maintaining at least 75% health, we can kill max health zombies in a single strike from a manhattan distance of 2 spaces away.
